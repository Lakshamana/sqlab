# SQLab
This is my SQL Lab, where I made a collection of SQL queries written 
in human readable language, with its SQL transcription (using any RDMS SQL).

## Steps to use this lab
1. Go to each link given the below relation and download the sample databse 
schema and the data to query to.
2. Run each query using your prefered RDBMS and enjoy!

- Relation filename / sample database schema + data url
- employees / https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/

Any further schema will be appended to this relation =)
